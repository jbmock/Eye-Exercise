# Eye-Exercise
Description: This project showcases the magic that can occur when HTML, CSS, and JS all come together. Watch as the eyes “watch” your pointer’s every move. This Eye Movement project has taught me how to bind events with the DOM to create a more interactive experience for the user.

How to run: Load the index.html file in your browser and move your mouse around. The eyes will follow the direction of the cursor. 

Future Improvements: Adding some more CSS features would make this project more appealing.
